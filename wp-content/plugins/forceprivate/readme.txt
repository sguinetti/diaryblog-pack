Force all posts by users without Editor or higher role to be private

== Description ==

Force all posts by users without Editor or higher role to be private.

This plugin allows you to give your post writers the ability to create and publish posts on your site that are only visible to
the author, and to editors/admins, by forcing all their posts to be private.

Features:

*   Anyone who does not have the 'edit_private_posts' capability can only post private posts
*   Limit all posts, or only newly added posts
*   (Optional) Also force a post to have a specific category when posted
*   Editors, admins and Super admins (who do have the 'edit_private_posts') can see all posts, and switch them from private to public if required.
*   No Configuration!
*   Just Activate!

This is my first publicly released plugin... so I hope you like it. Let me know if you find any bugs!

== Installation ==

1. Unzip and upload the `ForcePrivate` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Configure settings via Settings > ForcePrivate
